## Introduction

This repo contains the four R code files and associated data plots for the *Project 1* assignment of <a href="https://class.coursera.org/exdata-006">Exploratory Data Analysis</a>.

## Source Data

Information used to produce the grids can be obtained <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">online</a>. For this work, the datafile has been condensed down into a smaller working file, and thus the full datafile is not needed to repoduce the experiement. A complete description of the data can be found at the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>.

## Generating the working datafile

The script generate_datafile.R can be used to subset the data for the specific dates of [1,2] Feburary 2007.  This smaller working datafile can easily be read into the scripts and generate the plots.

A copy of the working datafile is included in this repository, but can be regenerated by downloading the source datafile, extracting the archive, and running the *generate_datafile.R* in the same directory.  The script will produce an outputfile named *project1_datafile.Rda*.

## Generating the plots

Each of the R code files are self-contained - there should be no need to load additional libraries or source utility resources. Each script loads the working datafile and outputs a PNG graphic similarly named but with a *.png* extension.
